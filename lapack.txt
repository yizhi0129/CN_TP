lapack is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides LAPACK in Accelerate.framework.

For compilers to find lapack you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/lapack/include"

For pkg-config to find lapack you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib/pkgconfig"



gcc -o your_program your_program.c -framework Accelerate
